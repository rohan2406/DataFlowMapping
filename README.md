# DataFlowLogMapping

Here I have assumed the TCP protocol to have IANA protocol number of the traffic as 6, UDP as 17 and icmp as 1.

To run the Code:

1. Clone the code into your machine.
2. Run the FlowLogParser class, that will fetch the lookup table and flow logs and generate the output_report based on the mappings.
